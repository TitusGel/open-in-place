# Open in Place

Minimal example app that illustrates how to get open-in-place to work well with the iOS document pickers.
It shows how to:
- invoke the document picker for files and directories
- use and persist the security scoped URLs the document picker gives you
- how to work with a directory in a coordinated manner to stay in sync
- how to edit a text file in a coordinated manner
